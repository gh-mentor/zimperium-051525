# Improving the OrderProcessor Class

The goal of this exercise is to refactor and enhance the `OrderProcessor` class to make it more maintainable, testable, and robust. Follow the steps below to improve the class and ensure comprehensive test coverage.

## Objectives

1. **Refactor for Maintainability**
   - Break down deeply nested logic in the `processOrder` method into smaller, reusable helper methods.
   - Ensure the class adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

2. **Add Granular Error Handling**
   - Replace generic exception handling with specific exception types (e.g., `IllegalArgumentException`, `NullPointerException`).
   - Ensure all exceptions are logged appropriately.

3. **Integrate Logging**
   - Use the `java.util.logging` or `SLF4J` framework to add logging statements.
   - Log key events, such as order processing start, success, and failure, as well as exceptions.

4. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Use the JUnit 5 framework to write unit tests for all public methods.
   - Cover edge cases, such as empty orders, invalid quantities, and null customers.
   - Ensure 100% code coverage.

5. **Mock Dependencies**
   - Use the Mockito library to mock external dependencies (e.g., payment processing, notification services).
   - Focus tests on the behavior of the `OrderProcessor` class.
