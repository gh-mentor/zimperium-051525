# Java Producer-Consumer Example Instructions

The code demonstrates a simple producer-consumer example. The goal is to improve the design by following best practices for Java development.

## Key Objectives
- Understand the existing code and the purpose of the producer-consumer pattern.
- Refactor the code to adhere to Java best practices and design principles, such as SOLID principles.
- Separate implementation into appropriate classes and interfaces to ensure clean design and maintainability.
- Use asynchronous programming constructs in Java, such as `CompletableFuture` or `ExecutorService`, to handle asynchronous tasks effectively.
- Ensure proper error handling and resource management.

## Refactoring Guidelines
- Follow the provided coding standards:
  - Use camelCase for variable and method names.
  - Use PascalCase for class and interface names.
  - Use `private` for member variables and prefix them with `_`.
  - Use `final` for fields that do not change after initialization.
  - Favor composition over inheritance where applicable.
- Refactor the code to separate design and implementation by using interfaces and implementation classes.
- Use `StringBuilder` for string concatenation in loops or performance-critical code.
- Ensure all methods have proper Javadoc comments.
- Avoid deeply nested code by refactoring into smaller methods.

## Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all public methods and classes using JUnit 5.
- Ensure tests cover both typical and edge cases.
- Use descriptive names for test cases and methods.
- Verify that all tests are self-contained and do not rely on external state.

## Next Steps
1. Refactor the code to follow the above guidelines.
2. Write unit tests to validate the functionality of the producer and consumer classes.
3. Build and run the code to ensure it works as expected.
4. Use Copilot Chat to review the refactored code and suggest further improvements if necessary.
