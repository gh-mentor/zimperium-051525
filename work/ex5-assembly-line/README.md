Assembly Line Simulation

In this exercise you will be Implementing all methods of The FactoryAssemblyLine class. The FactoryAssemblyLine cla```ss is a minimal simulation of an assembly line in a factory. The tests folder contains completed tests that will test your implementation. 

The goal of this exercise is to implement the FactoryAssemblyLine class so that all tests pass.


To build and run the tests, follow these steps:
```

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   ```
   cd ex5-assembly-line
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory**: 
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Run CMake to Configure the Project**: 
   ```
   cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
   ```

4 **Build the Project**: 
   ```
   mingw32-make
   ```

5. **Run the Tests**: 
   ```
   .\FactoryAssemblyLineTest.exe --success
   OR
   .\FactoryAssemblyLineTest.exe --fail
   ```

6. **Return to the Root Directory**: 
   ```
   cd ..
   ```
