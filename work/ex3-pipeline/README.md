### Modern C++ Concurrency Pipeline Example

This example highlights the importance of crafting effective prompts when using Copilot for AI assistance. By showcasing a C++ program that implements concurrency patterns with threads, tasks, and queues, it demonstrates how clear, structured prompts can guide the development of robust and efficient solutions.

Use Copilot to generate initial implementations and iterate on the prompts to refine the results. Experiment with different levels of detail in your prompts to guide Copilot effectively.

Alternatively, use Copilot to generate all the functions in the specification initially and then iteratively refine them. This method allows you to quickly scaffold the entire pipeline and get a high-level view of how the components interact. Once the basic structure is in place, you can focus on refining each function to meet the specifications, handle edge cases, and optimize performance.

**TODO**:
Using the content in 'doc.md':
- create the application by following the 'Project Setup Instructions'
- implement each step in the 'Specifications' section. 
- create tests for each component as described in the 'Testing' section. 

Tip: Use Copilot Agent 'send with codebase' to send the code to the workspace. This will help you to keep track of the changes made and allow you to easily revert back if needed.
