Creating a REST API with a SQLite data layer.

The file 'doc.md' contains the following sections:
1. Planning a web API application using modern C++
2. High-level design and implementation details
3. Future enhancements

Review the sections, then use Copilot to build out an application that meets the requirements.

Consider starting with the following prompt:
- Create the SQLite script using the steps outlined in the 'scripts/README.md' file.
- Please review Section 1 and respond with advice based on the requirements.
- I need to use the sqlite script  '/scripts/inventory.sql' to create a sqlite database '/SQLite/inventory.db'. Where can I find the sqlite tool and how do I use it to perform the conversion? Provide concise, easy-to-understand steps.


Reminder: Sections 2 and 3 are guidelines for the implementation and testing phase of the development process and may require several refinement iterations before the final product is ready for deployment.
