# Generating the Inventory SQLite Script with Copilot AI

This document provides steps to generate the inventory management system script (scripts/inventory.sql) using Copilot AI. The script is designed to create and manage an inventory system efficiently, leveraging Copilot AI to streamline the development process.

## Steps to Generate the Script

1. **Define the Schema Requirements**
   Use a clear and concise prompt to describe the schema requirements. For example:
   ```
   Create an SQLite script 'scripts/inventory.sql' for an inventory management system with the following:
   - Step 1: Enable foreign key constraints.
   - Step 2: Create a `suppliers` table with columns: `supplier_id` (primary key), `supplier_name`, `contact_name`, `phone`.
   - Step 3: Create a `categories` table with columns: `category_id` (primary key), `category_name`, `supplier_id` (foreign key referencing `suppliers`).
   - Step 4: Create a `products` table with columns: `product_id` (primary key), `product_name`, `category_id` (foreign key referencing `categories`), `price`, `stock`.
   - Step 5: Create a `product_list` view combining product, category, and supplier details.
   - Step 6: Populate the `suppliers` table with sample data.
   - Step 7: Populate the `categories` table with sample data.
   - Step 8: Populate the `products` table with sample data.
   ```

2. **Review the Generated Script**  
   Carefully review the script generated by Copilot AI to ensure it meets the requirements and adheres to best practices.

3. **Test the Script**  
   Execute the script in an SQLite environment to verify that:
   - Tables are created correctly.
   - Foreign key constraints are enforced.
   - Sample data is inserted as expected.
   - The `product_list` view returns the correct data.

4. **Iterate if Necessary**  
   If the script does not meet the requirements, refine the prompt and regenerate the script using Copilot AI.
