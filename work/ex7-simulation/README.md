This advanced workshop will test your knowledge of the concepts learned in the previous training sessions using GitHub Copilot as you AI Assistant.  The goal of this workshop is to help you apply what you have learned in a practical way, and to prepare you for real-world scenarios.

You will be designing, implementing, and testing a simulation of a system, and you will need to use the skills you have learned in the previous workshops to complete them. The goal of this workshop is to help you apply what you have learned in a practical way, and to prepare you for real-world scenarios.

Consider starting by adding the doc.txt file to the Copilot context, then ask Copilot to provide a high-level plan to implement the simulation. You can then ask Copilot Chat to help you with the implementation of each part of the simulation, and to test it. Additionally, remember to document your progress and any challenges you encounter during the process. You may also want to review the previous workshop materials for additional insights and strategies.
