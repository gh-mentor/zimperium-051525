
The code is a simple producer-consumer example using std::promise and std::future. The goal is to improve the design by following best practices.

1)  Be sure to understand the existing code and the purpose of using std::promise and std::future.
2)  Identify areas for improvement, such as code readability, maintainability, and error handling.
3)  Refactor the code to improve its design, such as using interfaces, encapsulating thread management, and abstracting the communication mechanism.
4)  Implement proper error handling and exception safety in the code.
5)  Implement 'DocTest' unit tests to validate the functionality of the system.
